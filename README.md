# Using the library
The library is still in early development, thus the [documentation](https://www.github.com/riacob/TFTFXLib/docs/) is practically non-existant.
<br>
Refer to the comments in the code (especially in *screen*.h and FXWindowManager.h) to understand how to setup the library to create windows with widgets.
<br>
To create a new widget, you should implement the parent class FXWidget() and build the new widget similarly to the existing ones.
<br>
Widgets are mainly composed of a draw() method and some style/content settings, as well as callback function settings.

# Contributing
Users are more than welcome to contribute, testing the library and introducing new widgets! Just submit a pull request with your widget, and you will be credited in the code and here!
<br>
Maybe check out [the TODO list](https://www.github.com/riacob/TFTFXLib/docs/TODO.md) if you want to contribute to my ideas. Make sure to check that the idea wasn't already developed and I forgot to remove it, but, if that's the case, and if you think your implementation might be better, feel free to submit it.
