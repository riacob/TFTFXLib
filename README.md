Maybe check out [the TODO list](https://www.github.com/riacob/TFTFXLib/docs/TODO.md) if you want to contribute to my ideas. Make sure to check that the idea wasn't already developed and I forgot to remove it, but, if that's the case, and if you think your implementation might be better, feel free to submit it.
