# Using the library
The library is still in early development, thus the [documentation](https://www.github.com/riacob/TFTFXLib/docs/) is scarce.
<br>
Refer to what's available & feel free to open issues.
<br>
Doxygen generates most of the documentation, however there are still bits of it that need a lot of work and time to complete. Plus things tend to change quite often, as I find some code needs optimizations or improvements, again because this is still in early development.

# Contributing
Users are more than welcome to contribute, testing the library and introducing new widgets! Just submit a pull request with your widget, and you will be credited in the code and here!
<br>
Maybe check out [the TODO list](https://www.github.com/riacob/TFTFXLib/docs/TODO.md) if you want to contribute to my ideas. Make sure to check that the idea wasn't already developed and I forgot to remove it, but, if that's the case, and if you think your implementation might be better, feel free to submit it.
